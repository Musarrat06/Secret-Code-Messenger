# Secret-Code-Messenger : Python_Project:

Developed a Python program on Google Colab that enables users to send secret messages using a custom encryption algorithm. The program allows users to input a message, encrypt it using a unique code, and send the encrypted message to others for decryption.

**Key Responsibilities:**
Designed and implemented the encryption algorithm for converting plain text messages into secret codes.
Developed a user-friendly interface that prompts users for input, displays encrypted messages, and enables decryption.
Ensured data security by implementing encryption and decryption functionalities.

**Technologies and Tools:**
Google Colab: Employed the cloud-based platform for coding and executing the program.

**Outcome:**
Successfully developed a functional Secret Code Messenger program, demonstrating proficiency in Python programming and data encryption techniques.
Enhanced problem-solving skills by designing and implementing a custom encryption algorithm.
Gained experience in user interface development and ensuring data security.
